  Comprehensive guide for building and maintaining GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw).
  Covers architecture, security boundaries, fork handling, safe outputs, anti-patterns,
  compilation, and troubleshooting. Use when creating or editing gh-aw workflow .md files,
  writing safe-outputs configurations, configuring fork PR handling, setting up integrity
  filtering, debugging "why doesn't my workflow trigger", or any task involving
  .github/workflows/*.md or .lock.yml files, resolving .lock.yml merge conflicts. Also use when asked about
  slash commands, pre-agent-steps, protected files, or agentic workflow security.

# gh-aw (GitHub Agentic Workflows) Guide

This skill provides a complete reference for building, securing, and maintaining GitHub Agentic Workflows. It covers the gh-aw platform's architecture, security model, and all available features.

> **Version baseline:** This guide covers features through **v0.71.5** (latest stable). A fresh `gh extension install github/gh-aw` installs v0.71.5. Verify your compiler version with `gh aw --version` and upgrade if needed: `gh extension install github/gh-aw --pin <version>`.

## Quick Start

gh-aw workflows are authored as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter, compiled to `.lock.yml` via `gh aw compile`. The lock file is auto-generated — **never edit it manually**. If `.lock.yml` has merge conflicts, resolve conflicts in the source `.md` first, then accept either side for `.lock.yml` and run `gh aw compile` to regenerate both `.lock.yml` and `.github/aw/actions-lock.json`.

```bash
# Compile after every change to the .md source
gh aw compile .github/workflows/<name>.md

# This updates:
# - .github/workflows/<name>.lock.yml (auto-generated)
# - .github/aw/actions-lock.json
```

**Always commit the compiled lock file alongside the source `.md`.**

### CLI Commands

```bash
gh aw compile <name>          # Compile .md → .lock.yml
gh aw run <name>              # Trigger a workflow_dispatch run
gh aw run <name> --ref main   # Run on a specific branch
gh aw status                  # List all workflows and their status
gh aw trial ./<name>.md --clone-repo owner/repo  # Test a workflow before merging to main
gh aw audit <run-id>          # Analyze a completed workflow run
gh aw logs <name>             # View execution logs
gh aw logs --filtered-integrity  # Inspect DIFC_FILTERED integrity events
gh aw upgrade                 # Upgrade gh-aw CLI extension
gh aw experiments             # Read A/B experiment state (v0.71.5+)
gh aw experiments analyze     # Statistical analysis of experiment results (v0.71.5+)
```

**`gh aw trial`** — Test workflows that aren't on main yet. Creates a temporary private repo, installs the workflow, and runs it. Essential for validating new workflows before merge, since `workflow_dispatch` requires the lock file on the default branch.

> ⚠️ **`imports:` gotcha**: Trial only has files available from the cloned repo at HEAD. If your workflow uses `imports:` referencing shared files (e.g., `shared/review-shared.md`) that haven't been committed to the source repo yet, trial will fail because those files don't exist in the trial context. **Workaround:** commit shared files to the source repo first, or test on a real branch with `gh aw run --ref` instead.

**`gh aw run --ref`** — Trigger a workflow on a specific branch. The workflow must already exist on that branch (registered by GitHub after the lock file is pushed).

## 🚨 Before You Build: Prefer Built-in gh-aw Features

**CRITICAL RULE:** Before implementing any trigger, output, scheduling, or interaction mechanism in a gh-aw workflow, check whether gh-aw has a built-in feature that does it. gh-aw extends GitHub Actions with many convenience features — manually reimplementing them is always worse (more code, more bugs, missing platform integration like emoji reactions, sanitized inputs, and noise reduction).

### Step 1: Check the anti-patterns table below
### Step 2: If not listed, check the [triggers reference](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/), [frontmatter reference](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/), and [safe-outputs reference](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/)
### Step 3: If a built-in exists, use it. If not, proceed with manual implementation.

## Common Patterns

### Pre-Agent Data Prep (the `steps:` pattern)

Use `steps:` for any operation requiring GitHub API access that the agent needs:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Fetch PR data
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
      PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number || inputs.pr_number }}
    run: |
      gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json title,body > pr-metadata.json
      gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --name-only > changed-files.txt
```

### Payload Sanitization

Comment bodies, issue titles, and PR descriptions are **user-controlled untrusted input**. In pre-agent `steps:`, always use `steps.<id>.outputs.text` (sanitized) instead of raw `${{ github.event.comment.body }}`. Within the agent job itself, container sandboxing limits the write surface (process escape), but does **not** prevent prompt injection (XPIA) — the model still reads untrusted content and may act on it. Rely on the platform's built-in XPIA sanitization and pair with tight `safe-outputs:` as defense-in-depth.

> 🛑 **Recursive workflow triggering**: Actions performed via `GITHUB_TOKEN` do **NOT** fire new workflow events (prevents infinite loops). Actions via GitHub App installation tokens or PATs **DO** fire events. This is why `github-token-for-extra-empty-commit:` requires a PAT — `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes won't trigger CI on agent-created PRs.

### Safe Outputs (Posting Comments)

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
    max: 1                      # blast-radius cap, NOT a retry budget
    hide-older-comments: true
    target: "*"    # Required for workflow_dispatch (no triggering PR context)
```

> **`max:` sizing principle**: `max:` is a blast-radius cap — it limits how many operations the agent can perform per type per run. The safe-outputs infrastructure handles API-level retries (HTTP 429/5xx) independently; extra headroom in `max:` doesn't help retries, it only permits buggy duplicate submissions (e.g., an agent hallucinating a second review post). Set `max:` to exactly the number of intentional calls your orchestration instructions require.

### Concurrency

Include all trigger-specific PR number sources. **Use `cancel-in-progress: false` for `slash_command:` and `label_command:` workflows** — a non-matching event (ordinary comment or benign label change) in the same concurrency group can cancel an in-progress matching run (the actual `/command`), killing the agent mid-execution:

```yaml
# For slash_command/label_command workflows — never cancel in-progress
concurrency:
  group: "my-workflow-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number || inputs.pr_number || github.run_id }}"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# For schedule/workflow_dispatch only — safe to cancel
concurrency:
  group: "my-workflow-${{ github.ref || github.run_id }}"
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

> ⚠️ **Pre-cancellation race**: Cancellation is asynchronous — GitHub sends `SIGTERM`, waits up to 7500ms, then `SIGKILL`. Already-running steps may complete. An agent that already posted a comment cannot un-post it. A `create-pull-request` that already ran cannot un-create the PR. **Concurrency is not a substitute for idempotency.**

### `slash_command:` Event Subscription

`slash_command:` compiles to broad event subscriptions — by default it listens to **all** comment-related events (issue open/edit, PR open/edit, every comment, every review comment, every discussion comment), then filters post-activation. This means:

- **Runner cost**: The pre-activation job runs on every matching event (~5-30s each), even when skipped. On busy repos this can be hundreds of skipped runs per day.
- **Actions UI noise**: Operators learn to ignore "skipped" runs and may miss real failures.
- **Concurrency collisions**: Non-matching events in the same concurrency group can cancel matching ones (see above).

**Always narrow `events:`** to the minimum needed:

```yaml
on:
  slash_command:
    name: review
    events: [pull_request_comment]  # Only PR comments, not issues/discussions
```

### The "Approve and Run Workflows" Gate

The `pull_request` trigger causes an "Approve and run workflows" button for first-time fork contributors. **This gate is dangerous, not protective**:

1. **Alert fatigue** — After clicking through dozens of legitimate first-time PRs, the click becomes muscle memory
2. **No per-workflow granularity** — A single click approves ALL gated workflows, including any `pull_request_target` workflows with full secrets
3. **No diff preview** — The UI shows no preview of what will execute or which secrets are exposed

**Design rule**: Assume the approval gate will always be clicked. The only safe workflows are ones that produce the same outcome whether the actor is trusted or untrusted. Prefer `issue_comment`/`slash_command:` (not subject to the gate) or `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` over `pull_request` when possible.

### LabelOps

gh-aw provides label-based triggering patterns for both one-shot commands and persistent state tracking:

- **`label_command:`** — One-shot command triggered by applying a label. The label is auto-removed after the workflow fires, making it self-resetting. Use for operations like "apply this label to trigger a review".
- **`names:` filtering** — Filter label events to specific label names for persistent label-state awareness.
- **`remove_label: false`** — Keep the label after triggering (for persistent state markers rather than one-shot commands).

See the [LabelOps pattern guide](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/patterns/label-ops/) for detailed examples and best practices.

### Noise Reduction

Filter `pull_request` triggers to relevant paths and add a gate step:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/**/tests/**'

steps:
  - name: Gate — skip if no relevant files
    id: gate
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    env:
      PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    run: |
      FILES=$(gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --name-only | grep -E '\.cs$' || true)
      if [ -z "$FILES" ]; then
        echo "skip=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      fi
  - name: Agent work
    if: steps.gate.outputs.skip != 'true'
```

Manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`, `issue_comment`) should bypass the gate. Use step outputs rather than `exit 1` to avoid red ❌ checks on non-matching PRs — `exit 1` fails the job, which normalizes failures and masks real errors.

### Fork PR Checkout (workflow_dispatch)

For `workflow_dispatch` workflows that need to evaluate a PR branch, implement a checkout step that: (1) verifies the PR author has write access and rejects fork PRs, (2) checks out the PR branch, and (3) restores `.github/` and agent infrastructure from the base branch SHA — defense-in-depth even though the platform also does this restore automatically.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout PR and restore agent infrastructure
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
      PR_NUMBER: ${{ inputs.pr_number }}
    run: |
      set -euo pipefail
      # Reject cross-repository (fork) PRs
      IS_FORK=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json isCrossRepository --jq '.isCrossRepository')
      if [[ "$IS_FORK" == "true" ]]; then
        echo "::error::Fork PRs are not supported in this workflow"
        exit 1
      fi
      # Verify PR author has write access
      AUTHOR=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json author --jq '.author.login')
      PERM=$(gh api "repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/collaborators/$AUTHOR/permission" --jq '.permission')
      if [[ "$PERM" != "admin" && "$PERM" != "write" && "$PERM" != "maintain" ]]; then
        echo "::error::PR author $AUTHOR has $PERM access — requires write+"
        exit 1
      fi
      gh pr checkout "$PR_NUMBER"
      # Restore trusted .github/ from base branch — must succeed or abort
      BASE_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefOid --jq '.baseRefOid')
      git fetch origin "$BASE_SHA" --depth=1
      git checkout "$BASE_SHA" -- .github/
      # .agents/ may not exist at base — guard separately to avoid aborting the script
      git checkout "$BASE_SHA" -- .agents/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

For `pull_request` + fork support (not `workflow_dispatch`): add `forks: ["*"]` to the trigger frontmatter. The platform automatically preserves `.github/` and `.agents/` as a base-branch artifact in the activation job, then restores them after `checkout_pr_branch.cjs` — fork PRs cannot overwrite agent infrastructure (gh-aw#23769, resolved).

### Operating Within a Fork

When you fork a repository, all workflow files come with it. Events inside your fork fire the workflows inside your fork, with your fork's secrets. This is separate from cross-fork PRs and is frequently a surprise.

**Guard pattern** — prevent workflows from running in forks (with a manual escape hatch):

```yaml
jobs:
  guard:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || !github.event.repository.fork }}
```

> ⚠️ **YAML gotcha**: Don't start a bare `if:` value with `!` — it's a YAML tag indicator. Always wrap in `${{ }}` to be safe.

> **Note:** This guard is for workflows running *inside* a forked repo — not for blocking cross-fork PRs. For fork PR protection, see Defense #5 under [Read-Only Contributor Write Surface](#read-only-contributor-write-surface): `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false`.

### Security-Critical Patterns

These patterns are the most commonly missed when building secure workflows. Use all where applicable.

**1. Role-based access control** — `roles:` controls who can trigger the workflow. Without it, any user (including the PR author) can trigger `/review` on a malicious PR designed to prompt-inject the reviewer. The default `[admin, maintain, write]` is injected automatically for workflows with "unsafe" events (issues, comments, PRs, discussions):

```yaml
on:
  slash_command:
    name: review
    events: [pull_request_comment]
    roles: [admin, maintain, write]  # Only committers can trigger — NEVER use 'all' unless you've audited every safe-output
```

> ⚠️ **`triage` role footgun**: `triage` is excluded from the default allowlist. A `label_command:` workflow (which requires triage to apply the label) will _fire_ but the activation job will _deny_ a triage user unless `roles:` is broadened. Add `triage` explicitly when triage users are the primary operators.

**2. Prevent accidental PR approvals** — always restrict review workflows; otherwise the agent can approve PRs and bypass branch protection rules (gh-aw#25439):

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  submit-pull-request-review:
    # COMMENT-only: no stale blocking reviews, safe for iterative /review re-runs
    allowed-events: [COMMENT]
    # Or allow REQUEST_CHANGES with supersede to auto-dismiss stale blocking reviews:
    # allowed-events: [COMMENT, REQUEST_CHANGES]
    # supersede-older-reviews: true
```

> **`supersede-older-reviews: true`** — When using `REQUEST_CHANGES`, set this to automatically dismiss older blocking reviews from the same workflow after posting a replacement. This solves the stale-review problem: without it, a `REQUEST_CHANGES` review persists even after the author fixes everything and re-runs `/review`, because gh-aw has no `dismiss-pull-request-review` safe output and the compiler rejects `pull-requests: write`. With `supersede-older-reviews`, the new review replaces the old one (best-effort). This makes `[COMMENT, REQUEST_CHANGES]` a viable option alongside `[COMMENT]`-only.

**3. Integrity filtering** — controls what content the agent can **see** (vs. `roles:` which controls who can **trigger**). The MCP gateway intercepts GitHub tool calls and filters content by author trust level before the AI engine sees it. Filtered items are logged as `DIFC_FILTERED` events — inspect them with `gh aw logs --filtered-integrity`.

| Level | Who qualifies |
|-------|--------------|
| `merged` | Merged PRs; commits on default branch (any author) |
| `approved` | `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`; non-fork PRs on public repos; all items in private repos; platform bots; `trusted-users` |
| `unapproved` | `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` |
| `none` | All content including `FIRST_TIMER` and users with no association |
| `blocked` | Users in `blocked-users` — always denied, cannot be promoted |

**Defaults:** Public repos default to `min-integrity: approved` when unconfigured. Private repos default to `min-integrity: none`.

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved        # Default for public repos — only trusted author content
    allowed-repos: "myorg/*"       # Scope to specific repos (optional; default "all")
    toolsets: [pull_requests, repos]
    trusted-users: [contractor-1]  # Elevate specific users to 'approved'
    blocked-users: [spam-bot]      # Unconditionally block specific users (always denied)
    approval-labels: [human-reviewed]  # Labels on issues/PRs that promote items to 'approved'
    # integrity-proxy: false        # Disable DIFC proxy for pre-agent gh CLI calls (default: true)
```

**`allowed-repos` scoping:** Restricts which repositories' content the agent can see. Accepts `"all"` (default), `"public"`, or an array of patterns: `["myorg/*", "partner/repo"]`. When specified alongside `min-integrity`, both fields must be present.

**`approval-labels`:** Label names that promote an issue or PR to `approved` integrity regardless of author association. Useful as a human-review gate: a maintainer applies the label, and the agent can then see and act on it. Accepts a static list or a GitHub Actions expression.

**`trusted-users` / `blocked-users` / `approval-labels` — GitHub Actions expressions:** All three fields accept GitHub Actions expressions (e.g., `${{ vars.TRUSTED_CONTRACTORS }}`) in addition to static arrays. This enables centralized management via repository variables or environment variables (`GH_AW_GITHUB_*`).

**Centralized management via `GH_AW_GITHUB_*` environment variables:** Organization-wide integrity settings can be distributed via Actions environment variables prefixed with `GH_AW_GITHUB_` (e.g., `GH_AW_GITHUB_TRUSTED_USERS`). These are merged with per-workflow frontmatter.

**`integrity-proxy: false`:** Disables the DIFC proxy for pre-agent `gh` CLI calls in workflow steps. Only use when you deliberately want to bypass integrity checks for a non-agentic step. Does not affect the MCP gateway filtering.

**Effective integrity computation order:** An item's final integrity level is determined by (highest wins): `blocked-users` (forced deny) → `trusted-users` (forced `approved`) → `approval-labels` (promote to `approved`) → endorsement/disapproval reactions (see below) → author association default.

**Reaction-based integrity (`features.integrity-reactions: true`):** Reactions on issues/PRs/comments can dynamically promote or demote integrity:

```yaml
features:
  integrity-reactions: true
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    endorsement-reactions: [THUMBS_UP, HEART]   # Promote item to 'approved' (default when feature enabled)
    disapproval-reactions: [THUMBS_DOWN, CONFUSED]  # Demote item integrity (default when feature enabled)
    endorser-min-integrity: approved            # Reactor's own integrity required for reaction to count (default: approved)
    disapproval-integrity: none                 # Integrity level assigned on qualifying disapproval (default: none)
```

**Interaction with `roles:`:**

| `roles:` | `min-integrity` | Effect |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Default `[admin, maintain, write]` | `approved` | **Most restrictive.** Only trusted actors trigger; agent sees only trusted content |
| Default | `unapproved`/`none` | Trusted actors only, but agent reads community content. Good for post-merge scans |
| `all` | `approved` | **Two-layer defense.** Any actor triggers, but agent only sees trusted content |
| `all` | `none` | **Widest exposure.** Must pair with minimal `safe-outputs` — only remaining constraint |

> ⚠️ **Compiler bug (v0.62.2)**: Hardcoded `min-integrity` in source emitted an incomplete guard policy (missing `repos` field) that crashed the MCP Gateway. This bug may be resolved in current compiler versions — verify your compiled lock file includes `determine-automatic-lockdown` before deploying. When confirmed fixed, prefer explicit `min-integrity` declarations for defense-in-depth.

**4. CI triggering + protected file safety** for agent-created PRs — `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes don't trigger CI; a PAT/App token is required. `protected-files` controls what happens when the agent modifies package manifests or `.github/`:

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    github-token-for-extra-empty-commit: ${{ secrets.PAT_OR_APP_TOKEN }}  # Required to trigger CI
    protected-files: fallback-to-issue   # Create issue instead of failing if agent touches .github/ or package manifests
    # protected-files: blocked (default) | allowed (disables protection)
```

**5. Fork PR checkout for `workflow_dispatch`** — the platform's `checkout_pr_branch.cjs` is skipped for `workflow_dispatch`, so you must implement a checkout step that verifies write access, rejects fork PRs, and restores trusted `.github/` from the base branch. See the [Fork PR Checkout](#fork-pr-checkout-workflow_dispatch) pattern above for a complete example.

**6. XPIA hardening** — Cross-prompt injection (XPIA) sanitization paths have been hardened. `disable-xpia-prompt` is now **rejected at compile time in strict mode** — do not use it. If a workflow previously relied on it, remove the flag; the runtime handles XPIA protection by default.

### Idempotency and the Edited-Comment Time-Bomb

**Slash command workflows MUST be idempotent.** Treat every activation as if the same command might already be running for the same target. Check before acting, claim a lock, no-op if already in progress or done.

gh-aw provides `lock-for-agent: true` to automatically lock/unlock the issue during execution, but use with caution — it prevents genuine users from interacting on the issue/PR while the workflow runs. In public repos, locking is visible to all watchers and may be perceived as moderation — use sparingly and consider a status comment explaining the temporary lock purpose.

**State tracking for scheduled pollers:** Use comment-based state to track what's been processed. Edit a comment's visible markdown to reflect status (⏳ in progress / ✅ done), and append invisible `<!-- state-machine -->` HTML comments as an append-only audit trail. This gives human-readable status and machine-parseable history in one artifact.

> 🛑 **The edited-comment time-bomb**: An attacker can edit a 6-month-old comment on a closed issue or PR, injecting `/command` or any payload — `issue_comment.edited` fires TODAY against today's secrets, today's `permissions:`, today's `safe-outputs:`. The workflow has no concept of "this comment was created when our security model was different." For raw `issue_comment`, use `types: [created]` — add `edited` only if you've designed for this attack vector.

### Read-Only Contributor Write Surface

> **What the agent can do is determined by `permissions:` and `safe-outputs:` — NOT by the actor who fired it.** When a workflow accepts a read-only contributor as the trigger (`roles: all`), that contributor effectively gets bot-level write access to anything the workflow grants the agent.

**What a read-only user can fire:**

| Action | Can fire? |
|--------|----------|
| Open an issue, comment, react with emoji | ✅ |
| `/slash-command` in any comment/body they author | ✅ |
| Open a PR (from fork) | ✅ |
| Apply a label | ❌ (requires triage) |
| Invoke `workflow_dispatch` | ❌ (requires write) |
| Click "Approve and run workflows" | ❌ (requires write) |

**Defenses, in priority order:**
1. Leave `roles:` at its default `[admin, maintain, write]`
2. Minimize `permissions:` to the smallest set the agent needs
3. Minimize `safe-outputs:` to only the mutations the workflow needs
4. For PR-touching workflows: never check out the PR head SHA in a job that has secrets
5. Add an explicit fork guard: `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false`
6. Configure `min-integrity` to control what content the agent can see

## Trigger Selection Guide

Choose the right trigger for your workflow. Triggers are grouped by recommended usage level.

### ✅ Recommended

| Trigger | Best for | Key advantage |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual escape hatch, debugging, ad-hoc runs | Write+ required; auto-paired with most triggers. ⚠️ Branch selection is user-controlled — a write user can dispatch against a stale branch with weaker `permissions:`, different `safe-outputs:`, or a friendlier prompt |
| `schedule` | Periodic housekeeping, polling-based PR operations | Best concurrency story; no event spamming; no approval gate |
| `labeled` / `label_command:` | Human-in-the-loop gate via label application | Triage+ required to apply label; one-shot with auto-remove. Consider `min-integrity: none` only when labels can be applied exclusively by write+ users — the label gate controls *who triggers*, but integrity controls *what content the agent sees*. Verify label permissions before relaxing integrity filtering |
| `issues` | Community-facing issue workflows | Immediate; `roles: all` acceptable with tight safe-outputs |
| `release` / `milestone` | Post-release/milestone automation | Trusted trigger (write+) |

### ⚠️ Use with Caution

| Trigger | Headline risk |
|---------|--------------|
| `push` | **Always** use explicit `branches:` — bare `on: push` fires on every branch including bot/dependency/codeflow branches. The trigger most likely to turn a PoC into a billing surprise. Rapid pushes (rebasing, force-pushing) stack runs unless `cancel-in-progress: true` |
| `issue_comment` / `slash_command:` | Broad underlying subscription; concurrency catastrophe; edited-comment time-bomb |
| `pull_request_review` | Fires for ALL review types including COMMENT from any user, not just approvals |
| `discussion` / `discussion_comment` | Most-open untrusted-input surface; no approval gate; lower visibility than issues |

### `pull_request.synchronize` Gotchas

`synchronize` fires once per push to a PR branch (not per commit). Things that do **NOT** fire `synchronize`:

- **Draft → ready-for-review**: Fires `ready_for_review`, not `synchronize`. Workflows using default `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]` won't re-run CI when a draft is marked ready
- **Base-ref edits**: Changing the PR's base branch fires `edited` (with `changes.base`), not `synchronize`
- **Pushes to the base branch**: Someone merging to `main` while your PR targets `main` does NOT fire `synchronize` on your PR — it fires `push` on `main`. Your CI won't re-run against the new base unless you push to your branch
- **Approval dismissal**: Branch protection's "Dismiss stale approvals on new commits" fires on the same head-SHA-changed event. A force-push that doesn't change file contents (rebase onto current `main`) still invalidates all prior approvals

### ⛔ Avoid

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `pull_request` | Causes "Approve and run" gate for ALL workflows; clicking approves everything including `pull_request_target` with full secrets. Prefer `slash_command:`, `schedule`, or `label_command:` |
| `pull_request_target` | Runs on base ref with full secrets and write token — most exploited vulnerability class. Never check out PR head SHA |
| `workflow_run` | `pull_request_target`'s quieter sibling — launders untrusted fork artifacts into privileged context with no approval gate. Classic pwn: sandboxed `pull_request` workflow uploads artifacts (e.g., `coverage.json`), then `workflow_run` downloads and acts on them with full secrets. Artifact may contain shell-injection or prompt-injection payloads. No UI signal connects the upstream PR to the downstream run. **Treat all downloaded artifacts as untrusted** |

### Design Principles

1. **Deterministic by default.** Use deterministic Actions and reusable workflows; agentic workflows only when the input is unstructured or AI unlocks a capability deterministic code cannot provide.
2. **Limitations ARE the security model.** Don't engineer bypasses (`pull_request_target` for write access, PAT pools to evade bot attribution, `workflow_run` to escape approval gates, `roles: all` to widen the actor pool). When a boundary blocks a legitimate goal, escalate to platform owners.
3. **Limit the agent job to agent-suitable work.** Keep filtering/skipping in pre-agent steps. Execute deterministic scripts before and after the agent job.
4. **Apply least privilege on every dimension.** Minimum `permissions:`, `safe-outputs:`, `network.allowed:`, secrets, `tools:`. The agent sandbox limits the write surface (prevents process escape) but does not neutralise prompt injection — untrusted input must still be treated as adversarial. The same operation in pre/post-agent steps runs on the runner host with full secret access.
5. **Mind the signal-to-noise ratio.** Convenience triggers compile to broad subscriptions. Every event spawns a workflow run consuming a runner slot. The activation step must be cheap, and the worst-case invocation rate must be estimated and acceptable.
6. **Understand the `GITHUB_TOKEN` recursion boundary.** Actions via `GITHUB_TOKEN` do NOT fire new workflow events (prevents infinite loops). GitHub App tokens and PATs DO fire events. This is by design — it's why `github-token-for-extra-empty-commit:` needs a PAT, and why bot comments via `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't trigger `issue_comment` workflows.

### Frontmatter Features

```yaml
source: "githubnext/agentics/workflows/ci-doctor.md@v1.0.0"  # Track workflow origin
private: true                                                    # Prevent installation via gh aw add
resources:                                                       # Companion files fetched with gh aw add
  - triage-issue.md
  - shared/helper-action.yml
labels: ["automation", "ci"]                                     # For gh aw status --label filtering
checkout: false                                                  # Skip repo checkout (for workflows that only use MCP/API, no source needed)

runtimes:                    # Override default runtime versions
  dotnet:
    version: "9.0"
  node:
    version: "22"

imports:                     # APM package dependencies
  - uses: shared/apm.md
    with:
      packages:
        - microsoft/apm-sample-package

on:
  needs: pre_activation       # Declare dependency on a custom pre_activation job for credential supply
                              # Enables sourcing GitHub App credentials from upstream job outputs
```

**`on.needs:`** — Express dependencies on custom `pre_activation`/`activation` jobs, enabling GitHub App credentials to be sourced from upstream job outputs. See also `safe-outputs.needs` for credential-supply dependencies in the safe-outputs job.

**`merge-pull-request` safe output** — Merge a PR directly as a safe output. Executes in the safe-outputs job with proper write permissions, not inside the agent container.

**`tools.github.mode: gh-proxy`** — Configure the GitHub CLI proxy feature. The deprecated `cli-proxy` feature flag is scheduled for removal; migrate to this form:

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    mode: gh-proxy
```

**Claude engine** — The Claude engine has two permission modes: `acceptEdits` (default — agent proposes edits that the safe-outputs layer validates) and `bypassPermissions` (activated when unrestricted bash `bash: "*"` is granted — agent executes directly). v0.71.5 fixed a stability issue where `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FAST_MODE=1` is now set automatically to suppress an incompatible server-side flag introduced in Claude Code 2.1.120+.

**`engine.bare` frontmatter field (v0.68.1+)** — Disable automatic context loading for supported engines, giving full control over what the AI agent sees. Use `bare: true` with `copilot` (suppresses `AGENTS.md` and user instructions) or `claude` (suppresses `CLAUDE.md` memory files). Also supported by `codex` and `gemini`. Unsupported engines emit a compiler warning.

**`engine.mcp` import support (v0.71.5+)** — `engine.mcp.tool-timeout` and `session-timeout` can now be imported from shared workflows. Previously these were only configurable in the top-level workflow.

**`small` model alias for sub-agents** — Inline sub-agent blocks use the `small` model alias by default, reducing cost and latency for lightweight agent tasks.

**A/B experimentation infrastructure (v0.71.5+)** — Full experiment lifecycle: define variants, run round-robin, collect per-run state, and analyze results statistically. New commands: `gh aw experiments` (read state from storage branches) and `gh aw experiments analyze` (significance testing, sample-size tracking). Experiment state can be stored in cache or a dedicated repo branch.

**`pre-steps:` frontmatter field** — Inject steps that run _before_ checkout and the agent, inside the same job. Recommended for token-minting actions (e.g., `actions/create-github-app-token`, `octo-sts`) for cross-repo checkout. The minted token stays in the same job, avoiding the masking issue when crossing job boundaries.

**Model-not-supported detection (v0.68.3+)** — When a model is unavailable or not supported by your Copilot plan, the workflow stops retrying and surfaces a clear error instead of spinning indefinitely.

**`checkout` field in shared imports (v0.68.3+)** — Shared importable workflows now support a `checkout` field for controlling which ref is checked out during import.

**`env:` field in shared imports (v0.68.3+)** — Shared importable workflows now support an `env:` field for passing environment variables to imported workflows.

**`push-to-pull-request-branch` target-repo fix (v0.71.5+)** — The compiler now correctly honors the `target-repo` field in shared PR checkout steps for `push-to-pull-request-branch`.

**Bundle mode for safe-output patches (v0.71.5+)** — Bundle mode is now the default for safe-output patch packaging.

**`allow-bot-authored-trigger-comment` (v0.71.5+)** — For bots that don't follow the standard `[bot]` naming convention, opt into the confused-deputy bypass explicitly:

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [edited]
  allow-bot-authored-trigger-comment: true
```

Standard `[bot]`-authored comments are auto-detected and bypass the confused-deputy guard without this flag.

**`engine.env` fixes (v0.71.5+)** — Multi-line block-scalar `engine.env` values (written with `>-`) now compile correctly. Custom job references in `engine.env` values (e.g., `${{ needs.my_job.outputs.value }}`) are now wired into the agent job's `needs` list.

**`report_incomplete` safe output (v0.67.1+)** — Report incomplete work as a safe output when the agent runs out of turns or budget before finishing.

**`checks` MCP tool (v0.67.1+)** — `checks` is available as a first-class MCP tool in the gh-aw MCP server, alongside `pull_requests`, `repos`, `issues`, etc.

**`checkout: false`** — Skip the default repository checkout when the workflow doesn't need source code (e.g., ChatOps commands that only call APIs via `web-fetch`). Saves ~10-30s of runner time.

**`engine.max-turns`** — Limit the number of turns the agent can take. Set in the engine block: `engine: { id: copilot, max-turns: 15 }`. Preserved through shared imports (fixed in v0.68.3).

**Available engines:** `copilot` (default), `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `crush` (experimental), `opencode` (experimental). See [Engines reference](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

**Engine feature comparison:**

| Feature | Copilot | Claude | Codex | Gemini | Crush | OpenCode |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| `max-turns` | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `max-continuations` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `engine.agent` (custom agent) | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `engine.bare` (disable context) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `engine.harness` (custom harness) | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Tools allowlist | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

**Available tools:** `web-fetch` (fetch URLs), `bash` (shell commands), `checks` (CI check runs), GitHub MCP toolsets (`pull_requests`, `repos`, `issues`, etc.). Use `tools: [web-fetch]` for workflows that call external APIs.

**MCP config location:** `.github/mcp.json` (previously `.mcp.json` at repo root). Migrate existing configs manually.

**`vulnerability-alerts` permission** — Available as a `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission scope for workflows that need to read security alerts.

### Observability (OTLP)

gh-aw supports OpenTelemetry trace export for workflow observability:

```yaml
observability:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ${{ secrets.OTLP_ENDPOINT }}
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${{ secrets.OTLP_TOKEN }}"
```

Traces include per-job spans with timing, token usage breakdowns, GitHub API rate-limit analytics, and Time Between Turns (TBT) metrics. Use `gh aw audit <run-id>` to view per-run analytics including TBT and API consumption charts. The `gh aw logs` command also surfaces rate-limit data.

### Security Hardening

**NFKC normalization + homoglyph detection (v0.67.4+)** — SafeOutputs infrastructure detects Unicode homoglyph attacks (e.g., Cyrillic characters disguised as Latin) via NFKC normalization, preventing safe-output key spoofing.

**Token injection hardening (v0.67.1+)** — Secrets are injected via `env:` blocks rather than inline `run:` interpolation, reducing exposure to shell injection.

**`--safe-update` renamed to `--approve` (v0.68.3+)** — The `gh aw --safe-update` CLI flag was renamed to `--approve` for clarity.

### Breaking Changes

**`network.firewall` removed** — This deprecated frontmatter key is now rejected by the compiler. Migrate with: `gh aw fix --write`.

**`add-comment.discussion` (singular) removed** — Use `discussions: true/false` syntax instead. Migrate with: `gh aw fix --write`.

Supported runtimes: `node`, `python`, `go`, `uv`, `bun`, `deno`, `ruby`, `java`, `dotnet`, `elixir`.
