.SYNOPSIS
    Scans gh-aw workflow .md files for dangerous trigger patterns and
    missing security gates.

.DESCRIPTION
    Checks each workflow source file (.github/workflows/*.md, excluding
    lock files and shared/) for:
    - pull_request_target without role restrictions
    - workflow_run without branch restrictions
    - push with overly broad branch patterns
    - roles: all on workflows that process PR content
    - slash_command with cancel-in-progress: true (agent-kill risk)
    - Missing allowed-events on submit-pull-request-review
    - steps: that execute workspace scripts after checkout
    - Missing protected-files on create-pull-request / push-to-pull-request-branch

    Outputs findings as a JSON array. Exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = findings.

.PARAMETER WorkflowDir
    Directory containing workflow .md files. Default: .github/workflows

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh Test-GhAwWorkflowSecurity.ps1
    pwsh Test-GhAwWorkflowSecurity.ps1 -WorkflowDir .github/workflows
